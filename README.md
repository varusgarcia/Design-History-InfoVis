# Design History Information Visualization
This is a project from the [Design History curse](https://incom.org/workspace/5910) at the [FH Potsdam](http://www.fh-potsdam.de). The curse and project is supervised by Philip Zerweck.

We've researched connections between common german Designers in the 20th century. This is the visualization for all the connections between them.
